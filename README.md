Modeling water level of CRMS stations at Grand Isle, Terrebonne Bay and Port Sulphur as part of the project to identify correlation between soil microbial communities and the environment.

## Downloading Data

**CRMS Data**
The Costal Reference Monitoring system which was created during 1990 in response to loss of land in Louisiana's coast.
Water level data is available via the [CRMS website](https://www.lacoast.gov/crms/Home.aspx) covering many aspects of marsh both spatially and temporally, however, it has to be requested before a link is available.  The data provided here was downloaded from the _Data Downloading_ section by selecting **Hydro** in the dropdown menu, and inputting site numbers before requesting a download link.

**CPRA Data**

CPRA is the _Costal Protection and Restoration Authority_, which encompasses CRMS and other programs along the gulf coast.  
CPRA houses data related to CRMS and other projects located at the [CPRA Data Download Page](https://cims.coastal.louisiana.gov/monitoring-data/).  CPRA hourly water level data was also used for the analysis but is noted in the code.

## Analysis
Analysis is provided in the notebook as well as thesis by Brandon Bagley on microbial community composition and correlation to external factors.

## Outputs
Charts, Graphs, and tables saved.
